 Non-blockchain-crypto-currency.-Munshine.
 White paper.
Crypto-token,that is not based on blockchain.
Backgrounder: 
       Blockchain and mining are two cornerstones of Bitcoin and both of these foundations are not solid. The blockchain determines the legitimacy of all transactions, and the so-called mining physically confirms each transaction on tens of thousands of continuously working computers. Mining is a tricky coined term to get people to run their computers and pay electrical bills for a reword, but if it made sense at the beginning, it’s obviously not now.
       Mining as maintaining a distributed ledger is highly inefficient compared to centralized ledger. The Blockchain as a collection of all past transactions is simply not needed to legitimize new one and takes up too much space. Therefore, the main cryptocurrencies - bitcoin, ethereum, monero with their circular signature already have problems, and in the near future these problems will grow. As a result, modern cryptocurrencies are only suitable for speculation, and illegal activities. 
       Because, first of all, this technology is extremely energy-intensive. Unlike ordinary money, fiat or not. Not only does the blockchain offer absolutely zero privacy/anonymity, it is also constantly growing, which lengthens the settlement of transactions. The cost of electricity is rising and will soon make mining unprofitable everywhere.
   If blockchain besides long transaction means: forget about anonymity, privacy and as a result security, mining is a reason why bitcoin is doomed. Without Mining Bitcoin doesn't exist, Bitcoin itself is a Mining! 
The world needs a better cryptocurrency:
1. Anonymous and private.
2. Secure. 
3. With fast, cheap transactions.
4. Stable, suitable for everyday payments.
5. Easy to use.
6. Offer protection for users against oppressive, undemocratic regimes and internet censorship.

Problem solution.
     So I designed a crypto-token, the first one that is not based on blockchain technology, with the following properties:
1. Anonymity: tokens are stored only in the wallet and no one knows how many there are. Even the server.
2. Security: the owner can freeze the wallet at any time, the owner in emergency can erase the wallet with all its contents and the owner can restore the wallet with all its contents.
3. Fast, cheap transaction in terms of cost and energy, due to the small size of tokens, lack of blockchain and mining.
4. Stable: in a Phase 2 new stable tokens are tied to a physical asset, where exchange points already form a dense global network. Stable tokens will be redeemable to gold.
5. Easy to use: transactions are automatically carried out in Euros and Dollars, as well as in other units of your choice.
6. Internet censorship breaking: Seller can send encrypted invoice to buyer using any secure messenger like Signal, Telegram, P2P or even regular email. Then buyer requests this payment to be processed directly through the server or via messenger as well. After that seller and buyer wallets updated according to invoice. This will prevent any oppressive entity to block transactions.

      I developed a business model for launching this cryptocurrency. It provides fast entry into the cryptocurrency market, fast capitalization and non-resistance from financial regulators.

Architecture
      It should be open source code, but open only to few reputable members of Free Software Foundation (FSF) community.
    To take advantage of the market share I propose two-tier of two non-blockchain tokens.
 One regular token with zero commission on transactions and after it will pick up pace another: stable, based on gold, with 0.5% commission on transactions.
      Tokens created at the moment of sale end sent to the user wallet as encrypted file, before that server checks authenticity of the wallet. Only official wallet is permitted. 
Server stores the hash of that file as the only record of last transaction for that address.
Transaction between the wallets goes the same way:
   The payer sending a request to the server for amount and payee address. The server check authenticity of payer file, reads its file, to make sure that there is enough founds for transaction, updates both files on the payer's and payee's wallets accordingly and keeps hashes of both files as the only record of last transaction. Wallets could locally keep the list of transactions for personal use. The wallet could read the encrypted file but not change it, only server may create and update the encrypted file, representing tokens.
Transaction itself will be very fast as the encrypted file is tiny. Commission paid by the receiver.
    The whole system is private and anonymous because tokens stored locally only. Users can choose to freeze the wallet for a certain time and completely erase it in the case of emergency by shaking smartphone, to protect yourself and save assets. After that user can restore his funds to the wallet using special encrypted key, stored separately in safe place.   
     To defeat internet censorship Seller can send encrypted invoice to buyer using any secure messenger like “Signal”, “Telegram”, P2P or even regular email. Then buyer requests this payment to be processed directly through the server or via messenger as well. After that seller and buyer wallets updated according to invoice. This will prevent any oppressive entity to block transactions.
   Thus the sum of both wallets will always remain the same, to ensure that funds cannot be sent to a non-existent address. This way the tokens will never be lost, wrong transactions roll back.

Protection from fraud insured by multi-level security:
1.	End-to-end encryption at all stages.
2.	Wallet authentication before connection.
3.	Mechanism of assets freezing, emergency wallet obliteration and funds recovery mechanism.
4.	Using a variety of any existing and future channels for communication. Impossibility of blocking.
5.	Non encryption transaction smart logic for fraud prevention.
6.	Artificial intelligence (AI) engine to analyze and identify possible future fraud.

   Secure messengers like Telegram and Signal invited to collaborate in mutual secure payment system development for the sake of freedom.

     Phase 2 will be launched on the same platform with the same technology. One stable token unit will represent 5 mg of gold, which in a present cost about $0.30. The wallet stores total amount in these units, but the same time shows the value in dollars and euros by feeding live gold price from the server. User may conveniently conduct payments in above currencies, but the wallet recalculates the value to stable tokens and makes the final transaction in tokens as well.  
After initial phase of lunching this stable token is over, the user will be able redeem tokens to the physical gold, delivery expenses applied.


          I also did some work on strategy of entering the crypto-currency market in the most successful possible way. Which I will discuss with interested party.
